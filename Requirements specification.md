# 1. Current State  

Developing a MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) webpage to create statistics based on user input about a specific large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning as it works as Hello world project for this area of study and good as starting point. Its simplicity and ease of use are what make this dataset so widely used and deeply understood by nearly are starting learners in the field of machine learning.

# 2. Scope

The aim for this is to make a solid project that can serve as database for user input where they can choose between 10 buttons on-screen (0-9). What number is shown in front of them then this number is taken as result for them then stored in database for afterward, where it is calculated for how many user got a specific number to be the one shown or missed it with another way as the numbers might be difficult for some users/clients to get it right at the beginning. 

# 3. Intended Audience

It works on two types of users, the first one is the input user that is going to feed the database with he info about the numbers as they will choose from the buttons on-screen, the second one are the students who will check if the statistics is good for the photos or not as there is percentage of accuracy that needs to be achieved.

# 4. Standards & Laws
## General Standards:
Application must have these general standards:

1. Must have a simple user interface that can work with all ages.
2. Must be easy for new user to get used to it.
3. Must use the industry best practices in showing album and artists to user.

# 5. Current business model

In fact there is not a specific business model as the project is intended to serve as a way to improve machine learning and there isn't a reason to have a subscription to do it and will serve a survey for user's opinion about numbers.
