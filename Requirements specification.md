# 1. Current State  

Developing a MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) webpage to create statistics based on user input about a specific large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning as it works as Hello world project for this area of study and good as starting point. Its simplicity and ease of use are what make this dataset so widely used and deeply understood.

# 2. Scope

The aim for this is to make a solid project that can serve as database for user input where they can choose between 10 buttons on-screen (0-9). What number is shown in front of them then this number is taken as result for them then stored in database for afterward, where it is calculated for how many user got a specific number to be the one shown or missed it with another way as the numbers might be difficult for some users/clients to get it right at the beginning.
