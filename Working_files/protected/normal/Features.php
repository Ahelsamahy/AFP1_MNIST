      <p class="lead mb-4 text-center">As in nowadays, it is hard for data analysts to improve their data about the image recognition as there is a gap between what the scientist want and what the user can deliver, tools that deliver the info play a big role as it is the connection between the user and the info in lab so they get the required data as needed
