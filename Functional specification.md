# 1. Overview
As it was sent form the client, they want to create a MNIST image recognition application and we believe that this project can be done in proper way with the tools that we already have and can deliver top notch user interface so it can be good with all ranges of users as it would be.

# 2. Current State  

As for now we are figuring out way to connect the project with database that have a wide range of images about numbers so we make the result more precise and narrow the field of error so we can achieve this by two ways. the first one is by having server that can handle heavy processing with all the images from different users being dealt with inside, which will eventually increase in the budget. The second option is to have a lot of users who are willing to spend more time on the platform so we take more data input from them, to do it you will need a good user interface that will keep them attached to it.


# 3. Scope
Is to have a good application that is capable of giving the client a precise result about what have users interned for different numbers based on what they have seen, and it will show with the calculation made in the back-end part of the website with the percentage of the users who entered the data and how many of them got it close to the image so it would train itself later in the future.
